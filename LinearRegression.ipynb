As you can see all the files have long and different names, which might become a peoblem when we will merge them into one (This is only an assumption). I think the better way to change the names of our file will be if we name it with the year's data it consist. I will try my best to keep this automated but looking at some files. It is not possible, so after automated task, I will perform the remaining manually.\n",

This issue can be resolved manually and it will not take much time but I think an automated approach will be right way to do."
